The study of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) requires efficient and accurate simulation tools. As the mobility of vehicles 
and driver behavior can be affected by network messages, these tools must include a vehicle mobility model integrated with a 
quality network simulator. We present the first implementation of a well-known vehicle mobility model to ns-3, the next 
generation of the popular ns-2 networking simulator. Vehicle mobility and network communication are integrated through events. 
User-created event handlers can send network messages or alter vehicle mobility each time a network message is received and 
each time vehicle mobility is updated by the model. To aid in creating simulations, we have implemented a straight highway 
model that manages vehicle mobility, while allowing for various user customizations. We show that the results of our 
implementation of the mobility model matches that of the modelâ€™s author and provide an example of using our implementation in 
ns-3.
